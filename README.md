# ⚙️ Installation and configuration

## Requirements
- Hardware:
    - OS: Recommended Ubuntu or Debian
    - RAM: Minimum 2 GB, recommended 4 GB
    - CPU: Minimum 2 cores, recommended 4 cores
    - Storage: 20 GB, minimum and recommended

- Software:
    - [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/)

    Install Docker using official script
    ```
    sudo curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh
    ```

> [!WARNING]
> **The latest version of the bot is compatible only with RemnaWave panel version 2.3–2.4.x**  
> Before installation, make sure your panel matches this version.


## Step 1 – Download required files

Create the project directory
```
mkdir /opt/remnashop && cd /opt/remnashop
```

Download `docker-compose.yml` compose-file and `.env` by running these commands:

- Get `docker-compose.yml` file:

    - For external panel **(the bot is hosted on a separate server from the panel)**:
    ```
    curl -o docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/snoups/remnashop/refs/heads/main/docker-compose.prod.external.yml
    ```
    - For internal panel **(the bot and panel are hosted on the same server)**:
    ```
    curl -o docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/snoups/remnashop/refs/heads/main/docker-compose.prod.internal.yml
    ```

- Get `.env` file
    ```
    curl -o .env https://raw.githubusercontent.com/snoups/remnashop/refs/heads/main/.env.example
    ```


## Step 2 – Configure the .env file

Generate secret keys by running the following commands:

- Generate secure keys
```
sed -i "s|^APP_CRYPT_KEY=.*|APP_CRYPT_KEY=$(openssl rand -base64 32 | tr -d '\n')|" .env && sed -i "s|^BOT_SECRET_TOKEN=.*|BOT_SECRET_TOKEN=$(openssl rand -hex 64 | tr -d '\n')|" .env
```

- Generate passwords
```
sed -i "s|^DATABASE_PASSWORD=.*|DATABASE_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -hex 24 | tr -d '\n')|" .env && sed -i "s|^REDIS_PASSWORD=.*|REDIS_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -hex 24 | tr -d '\n')|" .env
```

Now, open the .env file and update the variables:

- **`APP_DOMAIN`** : The domain used by Telegram and Remnawave to reach your bot.
- **`BOT_TOKEN`** : Your bot token from BotFather.
- **`BOT_DEV_ID`** : Telegram ID of the main developer.
- **`BOT_SUPPORT_USERNAME`** : Support username without the `@` symbol.
- **`REMNAWAVE_HOST`** : The domain or Docker container name.
- **`REMNAWAVE_TOKEN`** : Remnawave API token, created in the panel.
- **`REMNAWAVE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`** : Must match the value of `WEBHOOK_SECRET_HEADER` from `.env` the panel.
- **`APP_EXPERIMENT_TRIAL_ENABLED`** : Enable local trial A/B (default `false`).
- **`APP_EXPERIMENT_TRIAL_ON_WEIGHT`** : Trial-on percentage when local experiment is enabled.
- **`APP_EXPERIMENT_TRIAL_OFFER_START_DATE`** : Start date-time (ISO-8601 UTC) for `trial_offer` gate.
- **`APP_EXPERIMENT_TRIAL_LENGTH_START_DATE`** : Start date-time (ISO-8601 UTC) for `trial_length` feature gating.
- **`APP_EXPERIMENT_START_TIER_PRICE_START_DATE`** : Start date-time (ISO-8601 UTC) for `start_tier_price` feature gating.
- **`APP_EXPERIMENT_INTRO_PRICE_START_DATE`** : Start date-time (ISO-8601 UTC) for `intro_price` feature gating.
- **`APP_EXPERIMENT_CHECKOUT_FLOW_START_DATE`** : Start date-time (ISO-8601 UTC) for `checkout_flow` feature gating.
- **`APP_EXPERIMENT_PAYMENT_RESCUE_START_DATE`** : Start date-time (ISO-8601 UTC) for `payment_rescue` feature gating.
- **`APP_EXPERIMENT_ESTIMAND_ENABLED`** : Enable Estimand-driven assignment/events for production (default `false`). When enabled, the bot keeps the last good Estimand config for a short TTL and falls back locally during temporary Estimand outages instead of permanently disabling remote evaluation until pod restart.
- **`APP_EXPERIMENT_ESTIMAND_BASE_URL`** : Estimand API base URL.
- **`APP_EXPERIMENT_ESTIMAND_ORGANIZATION_ID`** : Estimand organization id used for config fetch.
- **`APP_EXPERIMENT_ESTIMAND_PROJECT_ID`** : Estimand project id used for config fetch.
- **`APP_EXPERIMENT_ESTIMAND_ENVIRONMENT_ID`** : Estimand environment id used for config fetch.
- **`APP_EXPERIMENT_ESTIMAND_FEATURE_KEY`** : Feature key from Estimand (set to `trial_offer`).
- **`APP_EXPERIMENT_ESTIMAND_FEATURE_ID`** : UUID of that feature (required to send events).
- **`APP_EXPERIMENT_ESTIMAND_TRIAL_LENGTH_FEATURE_ID`** : Optional UUID for `trial_length` feature.
- **`APP_EXPERIMENT_ESTIMAND_START_TIER_PRICE_FEATURE_ID`** : Optional UUID for `start_tier_price` feature.
- **`APP_EXPERIMENT_ESTIMAND_INTRO_PRICE_FEATURE_ID`** : Optional UUID for `intro_price` feature.
- **`APP_EXPERIMENT_ESTIMAND_CHECKOUT_FLOW_FEATURE_ID`** : Optional UUID for `checkout_flow` feature.
- **`APP_EXPERIMENT_ESTIMAND_PAYMENT_RESCUE_FEATURE_ID`** : Optional UUID for `payment_rescue` feature.
- **`APP_EXPERIMENT_ESTIMAND_ON_VARIANT`** : Name of the enabled trial variant.
- **`APP_EXPERIMENT_ESTIMAND_OFF_VARIANT`** : Name of the disabled trial variant.
- **`APP_EXPERIMENT_ESTIMAND_CONVERSION_EVENT`** : Name of conversion event sent to Estimand (`trial_activated`).
- **`APP_EXPERIMENT_ESTIMAND_REQUEST_TIMEOUT`** : Estimand client request timeout in seconds.

> [!WARNING]
> Depending on your configuration, also pay attention to the following variables: **`BOT_MINI_APP`**, **`REMNAWAVE_CADDY_TOKEN`**, **`REMNAWAVE_COOKIE`**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The bot requires a properly configured webhook to function.  
> In the Remnawave Panel `.env` file, set:
> 
> ```
> WEBHOOK_ENABLED=true
> WEBHOOK_URL=https://bot.domain.com/api/v1/remnawave
> ```
> Replace `bot.domain.com` with your actual domain.  
> This step is critically important for the bot to receive events correctly.


## Step 3 – Start the containers

Start the containers by running the following command:

```
docker compose up -d && docker compose logs -f -t
```

After a few seconds, you should see the bot successfully start.


## Step 4 - Reverse proxies

A reverse proxy is required to run Remnashop properly.  
It is needed to receive webhooks from Telegram, the Remnawave panel, and payment systems.

**This guide does not cover how to install or configure a reverse proxy.**  
You can use any proxy solution, similar to how it is done for [**Remnawave**](https://docs.rw/docs/install/reverse-proxies/).

> If you are installing the bot on the same server as the panel, you probably already have a proxy configured.  
> In this case, you only need to add a forwarding rule to route traffic to the bot container.

**Configure the following path to forward requests to the bot container:**

`https://your-domain/api/v1` -> `http://remnashop:5000`


## Step 5 – How to upgrade

To update and restart the bot, run the following command:
```
cd /opt/remnashop && docker compose pull && docker compose down && RESET_ASSETS=true docker compose up -d && docker compose logs -f
```

When using `RESET_ASSETS=true`, the following actions are performed:
  - All current assets are backed up with a timestamp (`/opt/remnashop/assets/*.bak`).
  - New assets from the image are downloaded and unpacked.
  - After the update, the bot will use the latest files.

> [!CAUTION]
> If you do not use `RESET_ASSETS=true`, the old assets will remain unchanged.  
> This may cause the bot to work incorrectly after the update.


# 🖼️ Banners

The bot supports custom banners for each page category and locale: `menu`, `dashboard`, `subscription`, `promocode`, `referral`. 

To set a custom banner, name it according to the target page and ensure it uses one of the supported formats: `jpg`, `jpeg`, `png`, `gif`, `webp`.

Banners should be placed in: `/opt/remnashop/assets/banners/(locale)/`  
Example: `/opt/remnashop/assets/banners/en/menu.gif`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not delete the `default.jpg` file — it is required for proper operation.


# 🌐 Translations
You can edit any translation file located in:
`/opt/remnashop/assets/translations/(locale)/`

After making changes, you need to restart the container for the updates to take effect.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Currently, translation persistence during bot updates is not supported.  
> When updating, your previous assets will be archived in: `/opt/remnashop/assets/*.bak`
